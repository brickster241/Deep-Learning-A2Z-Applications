# Deep Learning A2Z Applications
 Creating and Implementing various Deep Learning Algorithms from scratch in Python.  



 Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deep mind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.  

 But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.  



 Inside this Repository, I have worked on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (. In this repo, there are implementations of four real-world challenges:  



 - Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem.  
 - Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition.  
 - Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices.  
 - Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud.  
 - Data Preprocessing Template to transform datasets into Training set and Test set with appropriate Feature Scaling.
